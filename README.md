# Francesco Zappa's website
In this website I am showing all my relevant skills and some of the projects I worked on and that I am publishing on GitHub.

To make this website I am using [Cleanfolio](https://rajshekhar26.github.io/cleanfolio-minimal), a simple and basic portfolio template built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
